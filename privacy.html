  <h1>Privacy Policy for Kingdom-of-Chicken Bot</h1>
  <p>Last updated: June 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Kingdom-of-Chicken Bot (“we,” “us,” 
“our”) collects, uses, and discloses information.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discord User ID:</strong> We store your Discord ID to keep 
track of “jailed” users and moderation logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Role Information:</strong> When a user is jailed, 
we back up their roles in a JSON file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Use of Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your Discord ID and role information only to implement the 
“jail” and “unjail” features and to log moderator actions. We do not share 
this data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>All logs and role backups remain until the file is manually deleted 
or the user is unjailed. We do not keep data longer than necessary for bot 
functionality.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>If you wish to have your data deleted (e.g., your role backup), 
contact us at <a 
href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a> and we 
will remove your entries from our logs.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy at any time. Changes will be reflected here 
with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
