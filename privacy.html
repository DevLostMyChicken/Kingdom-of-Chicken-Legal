  <title>Privacy Policy - Kingdom of Chicken Bot

    This Privacy Policy describes how Kingdom of Chicken ("Bot," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our Discord bot. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    1. Information We Collect
    We collect the following types_of information:
    Discord User Information:
    Your Discord User ID: This is necessary to uniquely identify your game account.
    Your Discord Username and Display Name: Used for display purposes in-game, on leaderboards, and in administrative logs.
    Game Data:
    Character Progress: Level, experience points (XP), health points (HP), mana, in-game currency ("coins"), current location within the game world.
    Inventory & Equipment: Items you collect, craft, buy, sell, or equip.
    Skills & Stats: Your character's attributes (strength, defense, etc.) and skill levels (mining, fishing, hunting, crafting), including learned combat skills.
    Gameplay Activity: Records of battles fought, bosses defeated, quests completed, dungeons entered, items traded, minigames played, and resources gathered.
    Kingdom Affiliation: If you join or create a "Kingdom," we store your kingdom ID, role within the kingdom (e.g., leader, member), and join/leave timestamps. Applications to kingdoms are also stored temporarily.
    Cooldowns & Timestamps: Timestamps for various actions (e.g., last battle, last heal, last mission accepted, last dungeon run, last time a lootbox was bought of a certain type) to manage game cooldowns.
    Achievements & Titles: Records of achievements you've unlocked and any title you've selected.
    Lootbox Data: The types and quantities of lootboxes you own and timestamps for when you last bought specific types.
    Ban Status: If administrative action is taken, we may store a flag indicating if you are banned, the reason for the ban, and the timestamp of the ban.
    Database Backups: We regularly back up the game database, which includes your game data, for disaster recovery purposes.
    Command Usage Logs:
    We log commands you use with the Bot, including the command name, your Discord User ID, your Discord username, the timestamp of the command, and in some cases, your initial in-game coin balance before the command and the latency of the command. This is used for debugging, monitoring bot performance, feature adoption analysis, and identifying potential abuse.
    Administrative Logs:
    Administrative actions such as item grants, player resets, bans, or kingdom management actions performed by bot owners/administrators may be logged.
    Server-Specific Configurations:
    If your server administrator sets a custom command prefix for the Bot, this guild ID and prefix are stored.
    2. How We Use Your Information
    We use the information we collect to:
    Provide, maintain, and improve the Bot's functionality and your gameplay experience.
    Save and restore your game progress.
    Display your username and game progress on public leaderboards within Discord.
    Show your character information to other users via profile commands or in-game interactions (e.g., kingdom member lists, trade interfaces).
    Facilitate interactions between players, such as trading or kingdom activities.
    Administer the game, including enforcing our Terms of Service, preventing abuse, and providing support.
    Analyze command usage and game activity to understand how the Bot is used, identify popular features, and guide future development (e.g., admin_dashboard features).
    Communicate with you about important updates, announcements, or support matters, primarily through Discord DMs or a designated support server.
    Troubleshoot issues and provide support when requested.
    Conduct administrative tasks such as player data migration (developer tool).
    3. How We Share Your Information
    Publicly within Discord: Certain game information is inherently public or shared with other users. This includes:
    Your Discord username/display name and game stats on leaderboards.
    Your character's appearance (if any) and public profile information.
    Your username when interacting in public game channels or in multi-user features like kingdoms or trades.
    Global achievement announcements (e.g., "first to clear dungeon floor 25").
    With Bot Administrators/Owners: For purposes of administration, support, and moderation.
    Third Parties: We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share aggregated or anonymized data that does not directly identify you for analytical purposes.
    Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Bot, or protect the personal safety of users of the Bot or the public.
    4. Data Retention
    We retain your game data as long as you continue to use the Bot or until your data is reset. Command usage logs and other administrative logs may be kept for a longer period for analytical and security purposes.
    If the Bot is discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to inform users about data deletion timelines.
    5. Data Security
    We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our database is stored locally (kingdom.sqlite) and regular backups are made. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
    6. Your Rights
    Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. This includes:
    Accessing Your Data: You can view most of your game data using in-game commands like /profile, /inventory, etc.
    Data Correction: If you believe any data we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us.
    Data Deletion/Reset:
    Using the /start command if you have no existing data will create a new profile. If an admin uses /resetplayer on your account, your game data will be reset to the initial state.
    You can request the complete deletion of your game data by contacting us at LostCock@gmail.com. Please note that deleting your data will permanently erase all your game progress and is irreversible.
    Managing DMs: The Bot may send you Direct Messages (DMs) for tutorials or important notifications. You can usually manage DM permissions within your Discord client's server settings or user settings.
    7. Children's Privacy
    The Kingdom of Chicken Bot is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction if higher). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the relevant age without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.
    8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our support server or through other communication channels. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
