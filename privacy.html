  <h3>Command Usage Logs</h3>
  <p>We log commands you use with the Bot, including the command name, your Discord User ID, your Discord username, the timestamp of the command, and in some cases, your initial in-game coin balance before the command and the latency of the command. This is used for debugging, monitoring bot performance, feature adoption analysis, and identifying potential abuse.</p>

  <p>Administrative actions such as item grants, player resets, bans, or kingdom management actions performed by bot owners/administrators may be logged.</p>

  <h3>Server-Specific Configurations</h3>
  <p>If your server administrator sets a custom command prefix for the Bot, this guild ID and prefix are stored.</p>

  <p><strong>With Bot Administrators/Owners:</strong> For purposes of administration, support, and moderation.</p>
  <p><strong>Third Parties:</strong> We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. We may share aggregated or anonymized data that does not directly identify you for analytical purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Bot, or protect the personal safety of users of the Bot or the public.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your game data as long as you continue to use the Bot or until your data is reset. Command usage logs and other administrative logs may be kept for a longer period for analytical and security purposes.</p>
  <p>If the Bot is discontinued, we will make reasonable efforts to inform users about data deletion timelines.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Our database is stored locally (kingdom.sqlite) and regular backups are made. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessing Your Data:</strong> You can view most of your game data using in-game commands like <code>/profile</code>, <code>/inventory</code>, etc.</li>

    <li><strong>Data Deletion/Reset:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the <code>/start</code> command if you have no existing data will create a new profile. If an admin uses <code>/resetplayer</code> on your account, your game data will be reset to the initial state.</li>
        <li>You can request the complete deletion of your game data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:LostCock@gmail.com">LostCock@gmail.com</a>. Please note that deleting your data will permanently erase all your game progress and is irreversible.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
